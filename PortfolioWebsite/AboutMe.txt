I am an aspiring Data Scientist and University of Toronto student currently pursuing a double major BSc program in Computer Science and Statistics. I am passionate about Data Science and storytelling and over the years, I have cultivated my data analysis skills to become the best storyteller I could be.  I have honed my software skills through rigorous coursework and hands-on self-projects that have helped me become proficient in coding in multiple languages.
